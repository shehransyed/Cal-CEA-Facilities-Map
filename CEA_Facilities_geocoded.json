We prioritize food safety, quality and then customers.\n2. We put the team's success above any individual\u2019s\n3. We don\u2019t accept good.

The result is a unique culture where we cultivate personal growth in order to push our team to create meaningful positive impact in the world around us.\n\nHow We Got Started\nWe were founded in 2009 in Pierre Jr.'s dorm room while studying computer science at UC Riverside. Inspired by his dad to become an entrepreneur and by a college professor conducting hydroponic research for NASA, Pierre became committed to reinventing agriculture here on earth. Pierre raised a little money from his parents, friends, and family to build a prototype farm while also taking on his Masters in Business from UC San Diego's Rady School of Management. In this environment, our young founder met investors who believed in his vision and invested in Go Green."
