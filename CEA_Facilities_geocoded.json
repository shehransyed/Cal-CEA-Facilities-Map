That\u2019s where Plenty\u00ae comes in.\n\nCompared to conventional farming, our Compton farm\u2026\n- Has the potential to save millions of gallons of water per year\n- Can produce up to 350x more leafy greens per acre\n- Can grow an entire soccer field worth of produce in the size of a goal\n\nBy growing vertically indoors, Plenty\u00ae is able to dramatically reduce the natural resources required to farm at a commercial scale while also making it possible to grow where we used to think it was impossible, like in the center of a city or the middle of the desert."

Pierre raised a little money from his parents, friends, and family to build a prototype farm while also taking on his Masters in Business from UC San Diego's Rady School of Management. In this environment, our young founder met investors who believed in his vision and invested in Go Green."

The Stansburys would load their van full of plants purchased from a greenhouse in Pico Rivera and then peddle them throughout Orange and San Diego counties to retail nurseries.\n\nThe first nursery opened by the Stansburys was in Santa Ana Heights, California in 1980. Two years later they opened their doors at a new location in Cardiff, San Diego. The first nursery has since outgrown its original location and has moved a number of times, settling, for the past 20 years, in beautiful Irvine.  Our San Diego location has remained in the same location for over 30 years.\n\nThe complete operation now consists of over 165,000 s/f of greenhouses in four locations and is incorporated as California Greenhouses. Since 1980 their primary focus has been to present the professional interiorscape industry with the finest plants, containers, and accessories available. We have learned over the years that interiorscapers have a strong vision and are truly creating living works of art. Our job is to help facilitate the artist in anyway possible."
